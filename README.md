# ML Coursework Supplement – Cancer PCR/RFS Prediction

This small project is a **supplementary coursework work** completed during my machine learning course in 2023.  
The main goal was to explore predictive modeling on a medical dataset using Python and common ML libraries.

This is **not my primary project** but rather an additional demonstration of practical machine learning techniques.

---

##  Prediction Objectives

- **PCR (Pathologic Complete Response) – Classification Task**  
  Predict whether a patient undergoing surgery will achieve complete tumor remission.  
  Binary outcome: PCR Positive or PCR Negative.

- **RFS (Recurrence-Free Survival) – Regression Task**  
  Estimate the time (in months or years) the patient is expected to live without signs of recurrence post-treatment.  
  Continuous numerical prediction.

---

##  Dataset Summary

- **Clinical features:**  
  Age, ER/PgR/HER2 status, Tumor stage, Histology, Chemo grade, etc.

- **MRI image features (107 total):**  
  Radiomics descriptors extracted from MRI scans, providing quantitative data on tumor shape, texture, and size.

##  Techniques Used

- Missing value handling (numeric and gene-based logic)
- Feature selection (correlation + domain filtering)
- Model training with:
    - Linear Regression
    - Lasso Regression
    - Random Forest
    - Gradient Boosting
    - XGBoost
    - LightGBM
    - MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
    - SVM
- **Model Blending** using weighted average of selected models
- Evaluation with MSE and R² metrics

##  Model Blending Example
weights = [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]
models = [rf_model, xgb_model, lgbm_model, gb_model, mlp_model]

blended_preds = blended_prediction(models, X_test, weights)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, blended_preds)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, blended_preds)

This blending approach improved robustness and reduced variance on test predictions.

## Notes

This project was originally developed as part of a group coursework assignment.

The portion of the code uploaded here was ** written by me**, and reflects my individual contribution to the project.

While the overall structure and goals were discussed as a team, this repository contains the modules I personally implemented or significantly contributed to.

Please note that the dataset used is not publicly available and was provided for coursework purposes only.

## Disclaimer
This project is intended to showcase basic machine learning workflows as practiced in academic coursework.
It is not optimized nor intended for clinical use.
